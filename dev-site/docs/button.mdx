## Installation

yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react

## Usage

### PrimaryButton

The example below shows multiple instances of a `PrimaryButton` with various icon configurations.

Primary Buttons also have an `inverse` variant. While it looks similar to the default Secondary
Button, the default outline as well as the hover and focus states are different. Use this variant
when you need to place a Primary Button on a dark or colorful background such as `blueberry400`.

#### Example

### SecondaryButton

Secondary Buttons also have an `inverse` variant. Use this when you need to place a Secondary Button
on a dark or colorful background such as `blueberry400`.

### TertiaryButton

The example below shows multiple instances of a `TertiaryButton` with various icon configurations.

Tertiary Buttons also have an `inverse` variant. Use this when you need to place a Tertiary Button
on a dark or colorful background such as `blueberry400`.

### DeleteButton

### Custom Styles

All of our buttons support custom styling via the `cs` prop. For more information, check our
["How To Customize Styles"](https://workday.github.io/canvas-kit/?path=/docs/styling-how-to-customize-styles--page)
or view the example below.

### Accessible Use of the `as` Prop

Like many of our components, Buttons accept an `as` prop, which lets you change the underlying
semantic element - usually an `<a>`, or a `<button>`. This should be done with caution to ensure the
best accessibility. Generally, `<button>` elements should be used for actions, and `<a>` elements
should be used for navigation.
